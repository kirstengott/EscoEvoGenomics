The cellulose-binding function has been demonstrated in many cases, and appears to be mediated by three aromatic residues separated by about 10.4 angstrom and which form a flat surface. The only non-fungal occurence of CBM1 is in an algal non-hydrolytic polysaccharide-binding protein which is composed of four repeated CBM1 modules. Binding to chitin has been demonstrated in one case.",,cellulose,
