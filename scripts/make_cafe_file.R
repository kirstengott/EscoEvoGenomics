## for CAFE
# The data file may consist of data on one family or up to thousands of families for the specified tree.
# The first line of the data file should contain the extant speciesâ€™ names (as used in the Newick tree description),
# tab-delimited in no particular order.
# Subsequent lines each correspond to a gene family and contain tab-delimited family sizes for these extant species.
# Columns in the data file whose header does not correspond to any of the names in the Newick tree description,
# which may provide additional information about the gene families, are ignored and simply copied in the output file
